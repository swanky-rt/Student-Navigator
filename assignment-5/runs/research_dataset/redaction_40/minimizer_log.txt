<s> [INST] You are a trusted privacy gatekeeper. Your ONLY job is to decide which fields should be revealed, not to perform the task itself.


You are a privacy-minimization expert. Your goal is to select only the minimal set of fields that must be shared for the given purpose, balancing privacy and usefulness.

TASK CONTEXT: Release a research dataset with anonymization.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: release a dataset for academic or public research with strict anonymization. Keep only abstract or statistical information that cannot be linked back to individuals. Remove or generalize any name, ID, contact info, or internal code. The focus is maximum privacy and zero re-identification risk.
REDACTION STRENGTH: 0.40
- 0.0 â†’ share almost everything (very permissive)
- 1.0 â†’ share almost nothing (very strict)

  "job_description": "Join us as a Software Engineer at TechCorp. Contact john.doe@techcorp.com for details. Start date: 01/15/2025.  ssn: 123-45-6789 credit card: 4111-1111-1111-1111 IP: 192.168.1.1",

  "directive": "research_dataset"
}

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify which fields are **essential** for the task described.
2. Identify which fields are **private** (PII, internal codes, contacts, etc.).
3. Based on redaction strength, decide what balance is appropriate:
   - If < 0.3, prioritize usefulness (keep more fields).
   - If 0.3â€“0.7, balance usefulness and privacy.
   - If > 0.7, prioritize privacy (keep only safe non-identifiers).
4. Compare this decision against **similar but different directives** like:
   - Recruiter outreach â†’ contact and professional details may be kept.
   - Public job board â†’ only public-safe information.
   - Internal HR â†’ internal role analytics, not contact info.
   - Marketing campaign â†’ aggregated descriptors, no personal identifiers.
   - Research dataset â†’ only anonymized, descriptive fields.

Finally, output ONLY a JSON array of the field names to share. No Prose.
The **final line** must be the JSON array, e.g.:
["column_name1","column_name2",....."column_nameN"]
