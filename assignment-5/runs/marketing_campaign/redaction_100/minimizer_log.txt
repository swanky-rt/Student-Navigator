<s> [INST] You are a trusted privacy gatekeeper. Your ONLY job is to decide which fields should be revealed, not to perform the task itself.

You are a privacy-minimization expert. Your goal is to decide which fields from a user's record should be shared for the described purpose â€” balancing usefulness with privacy risk.
TASK: Design a marketing campaign dataset.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: share aggregated data with marketing teams to plan targeted campaigns. Keep broad, demographic, or behavioral descriptors that describe audience trends. Do NOT include individual-level contact or identifiers. The focus is on group-level insight, not personal details.
REDACTION STRENGTH: 1.00
(0.0 â†’ share almost everything | 1.0 â†’ share almost nothing)
USER RECORD: {
  "id": "505",
  "job_title": "Marketing Specialist",
  "job_description": "Join Marketify. Contact [marketing@marketify.com](mailto:marketing@marketify.com). Batch number: CARD-9876-5432-1111.",
  "company_name": "Marketify",
  "contact_info": "[marketing@marketify.com](mailto:marketing@marketify.com), +1 (555) 555-6677",
  "notes": "batch ref: CARD-9876-5432-1111",
  "directive": "marketing_campaign"
}
Think carefully:
1. Identify which fields directly enable the task.
2. Identify which fields could expose personal, traceable, or unnecessary details.
3. Adjust your decision based on redaction strength:
   - Low values (<0.3): favor utility, allow broader sharing.
   - Mid values (0.3â€“0.7): balance privacy and utility.
   - High values (>0.7): favor privacy, share only essential safe fields.
4. Consider that similar tasks may differ in purpose and sensitivity, so reason contextually.
Finally, output ONLY a JSON array of the field names to share.
The last line must be the JSON array, e.g.:
["column_name1","column_name2",...,"column_nameN"]

Based on the privacy directive and the user record provided, here's the JSON array of fields to share for the marketing campaign dataset:

["job_title", "company_name"]

Explanation:
1. The task requires aggregated data for marketing teams to plan targeted campaigns, so fields that describe audience trends, such as job titles and company names, are directly enabling the task.
2. Fields like contact_info, id, and notes should not be shared as they contain personal, traceable, or unnecessary details that could potentially expose individual identities.
3. Given the reda
