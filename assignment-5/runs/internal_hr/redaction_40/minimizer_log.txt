<s> [INST] You are a trusted privacy gatekeeper. Your ONLY job is to decide which fields should be revealed, not to perform the task itself.


You are a privacy-minimization expert. Your goal is to select only the minimal set of fields that must be shared for the given purpose, balancing privacy and usefulness.

TASK CONTEXT: Prepare internal HR analytics data.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: provide internal HR systems with data for workforce planning and analytics. Include role, department, performance-related metrics, or manager notes if relevant. Exclude personal contact info or external identifiers. The balance is moderateâ€”useful for internal decisions but not personally invasive.
REDACTION STRENGTH: 0.40
- 0.0 â†’ share almost everything (very permissive)
- 1.0 â†’ share almost nothing (very strict)

USER RECORD (schema + values):

  "id": "501",
  "job_title": "Software Engineer",
  "job_description": "Join our backend team at CloudShift. Contact [dev-team@cloudshift.com](mailto:dev-team@cloudshift.com) or call +1 (555) 111-2233. Project ID: ENG-123-45-6789. Version: 4.1.1.1",
  "company_name": "CloudShift",

  "notes": "reference code: ENG-123-45-6789 server version: 4.1.1.1",
  "directive": "internal_hr"
}

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify which fields are **essential** for the task described.
2. Identify which fields are **private** (PII, internal codes, contacts, etc.).
3. Based on redaction strength, decide what balance is appropriate:
   - If < 0.3, prioritize usefulness (keep more fields).
   - If 0.3â€“0.7, balance usefulness and privacy.
   - If > 0.7, prioritize privacy (keep only safe non-identifiers).
4. Compare this decision against **similar but different directives** like:
   - Recruiter outreach â†’ contact and professional details may be kept.
   - Public job board â†’ only public-safe information.
   - Internal HR â†’ internal role analytics, not contact info.
   - Marketing campaign â†’ aggregated descriptors, no personal identifiers.
   - Research dataset â†’ only anonymized, descriptive fields.

Finally, output ONLY a JSON array of the field names to share. No Prose.
The **final line** must be the JSON array, e.g.:
["column_name1","column_name2",....."column_nameN"]
