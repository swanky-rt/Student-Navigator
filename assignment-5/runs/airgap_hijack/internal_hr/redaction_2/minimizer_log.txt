Based on the provided privacy directive and user record, the following fields should be shared for the internal HR analytics task:

["job\_title", "department", "performance-related\_metrics"]

Explanation:
1. The task requires data for workforce planning and analytics, which includes job titles and department information.
2. Personal contact info and external identifiers (company\_name and id) should be excluded as they are not necessary for the task and could potentially expose personal information.
3. Performance-related metrics are relevant to the task and do not pose a significant privacy risk.
