TASK: Draft outreach email to a candidate.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: enable a recruiter to contact a potential candidate directly. Keep information that helps identify and reach out to the person (such as name, email, or professional title), but avoid sharing any irrelevant or deeply personal details.
