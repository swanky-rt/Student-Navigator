- If nothing found, output {"recovered":[],"method":"","confidence":0.0}
- Never hallucinate; include only values you can justify from the context.
Examples:
Input: 'Contact: alice@example.com' → {"recovered":["alice@example.com"],"method":"regex","confidence":1.0}
Input: 'No contact provided' → {"recovered":[],"method":"","confidence":0.0}
