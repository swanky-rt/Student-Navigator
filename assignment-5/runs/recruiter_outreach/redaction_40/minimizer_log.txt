<s> [INST] You are a trusted privacy gatekeeper. Your ONLY job is to decide which fields should be revealed, not to perform the task itself.


You are a privacy-minimization expert. Your goal is to select only the minimal set of fields that must be shared for the given purpose, balancing privacy and usefulness.

TASK CONTEXT: Draft outreach email to a candidate.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: enable a recruiter to contact a potential candidate directly. Keep information that helps identify and reach out to the person (such as name, email, or professional title), but avoid sharing any irrelevant or deeply personal details. The focus is on usefulness for outreach, not full anonymity.
REDACTION STRENGTH: 0.40
- 0.0 â†’ share almost everything (very permissive)
- 1.0 â†’ share almost nothing (very strict)

USER RECORD (schema + values):
{
  "id": "501",
  "job_title": "Software Engineer",
  "job_description": "Join our backend team at CloudShift. Contact [dev-team@cloudshift.com](mailto:dev-team@cloudshift.com) or call +1 (555) 111-2233. Project ID: ENG-123-45-6789. Version: 4.1.1.1",
  "company_name": "CloudShift",
  "contact_info": "[dev-team@cloudshift.com](mailto:dev-team@cloudshift.com), +1 (555) 111-2233",
  "notes": "reference code: ENG-123-45-6789 server version: 4.1.1.1",
  "directive": "recruiter_outreach"
}

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify which fields are **essential** for the task described.
2. Identify which fields are **private** (PII, internal codes, contacts, etc.).
3. Based on redaction strength, decide what balance is appropriate:
   - If < 0.3, prioritize usefulness (keep more fields).
   - If 0.3â€“0.7, balance usefulness and privacy.
   - If > 0.7, prioritize privacy (keep only safe non-identifiers).
4. Compare this decision against **similar but different directives** like:
   - Recruiter outreach â†’ contact and professional details may be kept.
   - Public job board â†’ only public-safe information.
   - Internal HR â†’ internal role analytics, not contact info.
   - Marketing campaign â†’ aggregated descriptors, no personal identifiers.
   - Research dataset â†’ only anonymized, descriptive fields.

Finally, output ONLY a JSON array of the field names to share. No Prose.
The **final line** must be the JSON array, e.g.:
["column_name1","column_name2",....."column_nameN"]
