<s> [INST] You are a trusted privacy gatekeeper. Your ONLY job is to decide which fields should be revealed, not to perform the task itself.

You are a privacy-minimization expert. Your goal is to decide which fields from a user's record should be shared for the described purpose â€” balancing usefulness with privacy risk.
TASK: Release a research dataset with anonymization.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: release a dataset for academic or public research with strict anonymization. Keep only abstract or statistical information that cannot be linked back to individuals. Remove or generalize any name, ID, contact info, or internal code. The focus is maximum privacy and zero re-identification risk.

Think carefully:
1. Identify which fields directly enable the task.
2. Identify which fields could expose personal, traceable, or unnecessary details.
3. Adjust your decision based on redaction strength:
   - Low values (<0.3): favor utility, allow broader sharing.
   - Mid values (0.3â€“0.7): balance privacy and utility.
   - High values (>0.7): favor privacy, share only essential safe fields.
4. Consider that similar tasks may differ in purpose and sensitivity, so reason contextually.
Finally, output ONLY a JSON array of the field names to share.
The last line must be the JSON array, e.g.:
["column_name1","column_name2",...,"column_nameN"]
