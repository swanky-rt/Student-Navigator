TASK: Design a marketing campaign dataset.
PRIVACY DIRECTIVE: Goal: share aggregated data with marketing teams to plan targeted campaigns. Keep broad, demographic, or behavioral descriptors that describe audience trends. Do NOT include individual-level contact or identifiers. The focus is on group-level insight, not personal details.
