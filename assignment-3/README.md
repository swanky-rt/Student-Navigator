## Model Setting and Dataset Generation
The model used is a 2-layer feedforward neural network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) with the following structure:

- **Input:** TF-IDF features (`max_features=258`)
- **Hidden layer:** size is swept (default 128, but can be 64, 128, ..., 1024)
  - `nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_units)`
  - `nn.ReLU()`
- **Output layer:** number of classes
  - `nn.Linear(hidden_units, num_classes)`

This architecture is implemented in the `make_model` function in the script.

For a 2-layer MLP, the number of trainable parameters is:

- **Layer 1:**
  - Weights: `input_dim × hidden_units`
  - Biases: `hidden_units`
  - Total: `input_dim × hidden_units + hidden_units`
- **Layer 2:**
  - Weights: `hidden_units × num_classes`
  - Biases: `num_classes`
  - Total: `hidden_units × num_classes + num_classes`
- **Total:**
  - `params_l1 + params_l2` -->

## Hyperparameter Tuning Modules

All hyperparameter tuning scripts are located in `code/Hyperparam_Tuning/`. These modules help identify optimal settings for DP-SGD training.

### 1. Privacy Accounting Comparison- strong_vs_moments_accountant.py

This module compares two differential privacy accounting methods used in training machine learning models with DP-SGD:

- **Moments Accountant (MA)** (implemented in Opacus)
- **Strong Composition Theorem**

It helps visualize how the privacy budget **ε (epsilon)** grows across training epochs under each method.

---
#### Purpose

- Provide a **side-by-side comparison** of privacy accounting techniques.  
- Demonstrate that **Moments Accountant yields tighter bounds** on ε than Strong Composition.  
- Serve as a reference plot for how important Moments Accountant is.

---
#### Settings

- **Model**: 2-layer feedforward NN with ReLU, hidden size = 128  
- **Features**: TF-IDF vectors from job descriptions (`max_features=258`)  
- **Optimizer**: SGD, lr=0.05  
- **Lot Size**: √N.  
  - Following literature (Abadi et al., Opacus examples), using lot size ~√N balances privacy and utility.  
- **Noise multiplier (σ)**: 1.0  
- **Clipping Norm (C)**: 1.0.  
  - Standard practice, keeps gradients bounded without over-clipping. 
- **Delta (δ)**: 1/N  
- **Optimizer**: SGD, `lr=0.1`.   

---
#### Inputs & Outputs

- **Input**: `dataset.csv` (columns: `job_description`, `job_role`)  
- **Output artifacts** (saved in `artifacts/`):
  - `epsilon_comparison.png` → line plot of ε vs. epochs (MA vs Strong Composition)

---

#### How to Run

```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/strong_vs_moments_accountant.py
```

### 2.  Noise Sweep - analyze_noise.py

This module evaluates how the **noise multiplier (σ)** affects the performance of DP-SGD when training a text classification model.  
It runs multiple DP models with varying σ values and compares their test accuracy against a non-DP baseline.

---

#### Purpose

- Empirically show the **trade-off between noise and model accuracy** in DP-SGD.  
- Provide intuition for choosing the right noise multiplier in practice.  

---

#### Settings
  
- **Features**: TF-IDF (`max_features=258`, bigrams included).  
- **Model**: 2-layer feedforward NN with hidden size 128.  
- **Lot Size**: √N.  
  - Following literature (Abadi et al., Opacus examples), using lot size ~√N balances privacy and utility.  
- **Epochs**: N / Lot Size.  
  - Ensures each record is expected to be seen about once.  
- **Clipping Norm (C)**: 1.0.  
  - Standard practice, keeps gradients bounded without over-clipping.  
- **Noise Grid**: `[0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.  
  - Covers low → high noise regimes, to visualize the accuracy dropoff.  
- **Delta (δ)**: 1/N.  
  - Widely used setting for DP guarantees.

  - Baseline accuracy line (dashed).  
  - Highlight of peak accuracy among DP runs.  

---

#### How to Run

```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_noise.py
```

### 3. Clipping Norm Sweep - analyze_clip.py

This module evaluates how the **gradient clipping norm (C)** affects the performance of DP-SGD when training a text classification model. It runs multiple DP models with varying clipping values and compares their test accuracy. I ran the hyper param sweep for different parameters, initially I tested the code with the values suggested in Abadi et al., but after tuning the params, I changed it to what graphically worked better for my synthetic dataset.

---

#### Purpose

- Empirically show the **impact of gradient clipping** on DP-SGD accuracy.  
- Provide intuition for choosing a suitable clipping norm in practice.

---

#### Settings
  
- **Features**: TF-IDF (`max_features=258`, bigrams included).  
- **Model**: 2-layer feedforward NN with hidden size 128.  
- **Lot Size**: √N.  
  - Following literature (Abadi et al., Opacus examples), using lot size ~√N balances privacy and utility.  
- **Epochs**: N / Lot Size.  
- **Noise Multiplier (σ)**: 1.0.  
- **Clipping Grid**: `[0.5×, ..., 2×]` estimated median grad norm (8 values).  
  - Median is estimated from the training data and snapped to the nearest tested value for annotation.  
- **Delta (δ)**: 1/N.  
  - Widely used setting for DP guarantees.

---

#### Inputs & Outputs

```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_clip.py
```

### 4. Other Hyperparameters - analyze_miscellanous_params.py

So after I analyzed how clipping norm and noise multiplier affected my DP model, I also wanted to investigate how the other params in relation to the model itself helps the DP model attain its best accuracy and epsilon budget. So,this module allows you to sweep and analyze the effect of various hyperparameters about the model itself (hidden layer size, lot size, learning rate) on the accuracy and privacy of a DP-SGD model for job role classification.

---

#### Purpose

- Empirically show how different hyperparameters affect DP-SGD accuracy and privacy (epsilon).
- Help select optimal values for hidden units, lot size, and learning rate for your dataset.

---

#### Settings
After running all the above code I was able to finalize the best clipping norm and noise multiplier.
- **Features**: TF-IDF (`max_features=258`, bigrams included).
- **Model**: 2-layer feedforward NN with hidden size (swept or fixed).
- **Lot Size**: swept or fixed.
- **Learning Rate**: swept or fixed.
- **Clipping Norm (C)**: 0.17 (default - best value from previous analysis).
- **Noise Multiplier (σ)**: 1.5 (default - best value from previous analysis).
- **Delta (δ)**: 1/N.

---

#### Inputs & Outputs

- **Input**: `dataset.csv` (columns: `job_description`, `job_role`).
- **Outputs** (saved in `artifacts/`):
  - `sweep_hidden_smooth.png`, `sweep_lot_smooth.png`, `sweep_lr_smooth.png` (or similar) → accuracy vs swept parameter plots.

---

#### How to Run

```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_miscellanous_params.py --sweep <hidden|lot|lr> [--smooth]
```
Examples:
```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_miscellanous_params.py --sweep hidden --smooth
```
```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_miscellanous_params.py --sweep lot
```
```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/analyze_miscellanous_params.py --sweep lr --smooth
```

### 5. Parameter Sweep Utility - param_sweep.py

This is a general utility script that supports comprehensive parameter sweeps across C (clipping) and σ (noise multiplier) as given in the question:
- Clip norm C ∈ {0.5, 1.0}
- Noise multiplier σ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}

#### How to Run
```bash
python assignment-3/code/Hyperparam_Tuning/param_sweep.py
```

## Main Training Module

The main training comparison is located in `code/Main_Baseline_Vs_BestDP/`.

### Baseline vs DP Training: train_dp_model.py

This module compares the training and test accuracy of a non-private (baseline) model and a differentially private (DP-SGD) model on the job role classification task. It supports flexible privacy settings via command-line arguments.

---

#### Purpose

- Show the effect of differential privacy (DP-SGD) on model accuracy compared to a non-private baseline.
- Visualize privacy consumption (epsilon) over epochs when using DP-SGD.
- Allow experimentation with different privacy budgets and noise multipliers.

---

#### Settings (Best Params)
After all the hyperparam analysis I have gotten these values below which works best on my dataset and DP setting.
- **Features**: TF-IDF (`max_features=258`, bigrams included).
- **Model**: 2-layer feedforward NN with hidden size 128.
- **Lot Size**: 60 (from hyper-param tuning (close to √N of N i.e 56); can be changed in code).
- **Epochs**: N / Lot Size.
- **Clipping Norm (C)**: 0.17 (from hyper-param tuning; can be changed in code).
- **Noise Multiplier (σ)**: 1.5 (default value- best from tuning) configurable via `--sigma` argument.
- **Delta (δ)**: configurable via `--target_delta` argument (default: 1/N).
- **Epsilon (ε)**: configurable via `--target_eps` argument (optional).

---

#### Inputs & Outputs

- **Input**: `dataset.csv` (columns: `job_description`, `job_role`).
- **Outputs** (saved in `artifacts/`):
  - `baseline_accuracy.csv` → baseline model train/test accuracy per epoch.
  - `dp_accuracy.csv` → DP model train/test accuracy and epsilon per epoch.
  - `baseline_vs_dp_train_test.png` → plot of train/test accuracy for both models.
  - `epsilon_curve_final.png` → plot of privacy consumption (epsilon) over epochs (if applicable).

You can test this code in 2 different ways:
1. Mention your budget delta (Accountant will get you the model for best epsilon)
2. Mention your budget delta and epsilon (Accountant will get you for the model for the optimal noise)

---

#### How to Run

```bash
python assignment-3/code/Main_Baseline_Vs_BestDP/train_dp_model.py [--target_eps <float>] [--target_delta <float>] [--sigma <float>]
```
Example:
